Cookie Notice Accepted is a minimalistic extension which sets cookies to tell your websites that you have accepted the cookie notice, so it wont ask you again.

## Supported "cookie notice accepted" cookies

- cookieconsent_status = dismiss (https://cookieconsent.insites.com/)
- cookielaw = 1 (https://github.com/valdecode/magento-cookielaw)

## Installation

To manually install Cookie Notice Accepted download all files to your computer and use your webbrowser to load it from your local machine.
This process is similiar, differs slightly, among different webbrowsers.

### Browser specific adjustments

Before you do so, there is one adjustment to make before you can start last step to take. Different browsers require slightly different manifest.json files. 3 versions have been included in this project.

If you use Firefox, rename "manifest.firefox.json" to "manifest.json"

If you use Edge, rename "manifest.edge.json" to "manifest.json"

If you use either Chrome or Opera, leave the default "manifest.json"
